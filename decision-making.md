#Decision-making

There are several popular approaches to decision-making, some of which are detailed here:
* Do-ocracy is an organizational methodology where each individual chooses his/her own role and/or task and does it autonomously or in a team. In this model, accountability sticks to the actor who implements a task/role, not who is officially assigned.
  * Advantages:
    * Fosters a culture of participation and motivates community members to take on responsibilities for the good of the group.
    * Can lead to much more rapid implementation, as there is little in the way of process to curtail progress on tasks.
    * Allows those who want to accomplish something to simply start working toward their goals.
  * Disadvantages:
    * Burnout of team core, especially when people volunteer for too many jobs/tasks.
    * If some key contributors volunteer for a large portion of the tasks, they may begin to resent others for not contributing as much.
    * Some may volunteer to perform a task without the required expertise to complete it, yet there may be no mechanism for taking the volunteer off that self-assigned task.
* Consensus is an organizational approach where decisions are made by the unanimous agreement of a whole group of actors.
  * Advantages:
    * Reduces social hierarchy, as all members' votes are required to progress forward.
    * Increases participation by all members of a group.
    * Imposes a natural limit on risky or controversial changes.
    are sustainability and deep understanding tack and roles by each member of collective.
    * Prevents minority viewpoints within a group from being overrun.
  * Disadvantages:
    * Extremely time-consuming, as a single dissenter can prevent forward progress.
    * Difficult to overturn previously-made decisions as members who espoused those ideas initially may be unwilling to recant.
    * Can cause social pressure on all participants to reach quicker decisions, paradoxically resulting in some groups speeding too quickly toward decision-making.
    * Parliamentary Procedure is a highly organized system of decision-making, governed by a fixed set of rules (such as Robert's Rules of Order).
      * Advantages:
        * Highly structured set of rules governs discussion, preventing personal attacks and the like from becoming commonplace, and reducing ambiguity.
        * Generally requires a quorum of members present, to prevent the risk of a clandestine meeting held to push through a small group's agenda.
        * Majority voting provides a clear, objective way to measure when a decision has been reached when a question is called to a vote.
      * Disadvantages:
        * Minority viewpoints can be overridden by votes, leading to a situation where an unscrupulous majority group could seize complete control over the body.
        * Discussion can become interrupted by the process moving too quickly to a vote.
        * People may feel less personally invested in the outcome from the other two systems (especially where they voted against the decision that was reached).
