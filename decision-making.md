#Decision-making

There are at least two popular approaches:
* Do-ocracy is an organizational methodology where each individual chooses his/her own role and/or task and does it autonomously or in a team. In this model, accountability sticks to the actor who implements a task/role, not who is officially assigned.
  * The main advantages of this approach: big motivation and rapid implementation.
  * Disadvantages are burn out of team core.
* Consensus is an organizational approach where decisions are made by agreement of a whole group of actors.
  * Benefits are sustainability and deep understanding tack and roles by each member of collective. 
  * Drawbacks: Very time-consuming and not flexible.

**Option: The better way is to combine the methods.
