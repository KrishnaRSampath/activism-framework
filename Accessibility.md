#Accessibility

* Campaigns need to think about and plan for how to involve people from different backgrounds and with differing needs.
* Strive to include people from different backgrounds and differing physical abilities in your leadership, as movements are shaped by those who lead them.
* Don't neglect age as a focus of diversity. Many activist communities represent a very narrow age spectrum -- focus on including a larger group of ages to bring more perspectives to the table.

#Events

* Plan to address these needs as early in the event-planning cycle as possible, to allow enough time to make any requested accommodations.
* Include language in your promotional materials that the event would like to be inclusive and accessible, and invite participants with disabilities to contact you with any accommodation requests.
* Here are some suggested ways to ensure a more accessible event from the outset:
  * Choose venues that are wheelchair-accessible, including ramps to get to the auditorium or other venues. Be sure that cafeterias or other food venues are similarly accessible.
  * Presentations can be made more accessible to participants who are blind or who have low vision by ensuring that no content is presented only through the slide medium, or by making visual content prepared in an alternate format (Braille, electronic text format, large print).
  * Presentation or film content should be captioned or interpreted for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing.
  * Make sure all event staff are coached and able to address important questions such as where accessible parking or restrooms are located.
  * Ensure that all spaces allow safe movement, by being well-lit and free of obstructions, such as bunched carpeting.
  * Make events free or pay-what-you-can to increase economic accessibility.

#Conclusion

* Remember, the effort it takes to focus on inclusiveness will lead to a stronger activist community.
